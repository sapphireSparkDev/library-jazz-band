    "description": "Hitting The Low Notes celebrates instruments from the lower end of the sonic spectrum, some not often seen in a jazz band. For this performance, the 17-member Library Jazz Band will be joined by two French horns, tuba, bass saxophone, and expanded trumpet and percussion sections. For the first time, the ensemble welcomes a guest conductor. The 75-year-old jazz elder Joseph Daley will lead the ensemble as they perform his seminal composition, The Seven Deadly Sins, a seven-movement piece based on the paintings of contemporary painter/musician Wade Schuman.",
