          LJB: A Jazz Orchestra for the Community
        </h2>
        <p className="text-center text-lg mb-14 font-roboto lg:w-fit w-fit">
          LJB was created in 2021 to address a gap in the musical landscape by
          reviving the big band tradition in their community. We are a dynamic
          17-piece jazz orchestra, featuring five saxophones, four trombones,
          four trumpets, piano, bass, drums, plus conductor. Our collective of
          seasoned professionals and passionate, experienced amateurs is united
          by a shared love for the big band format and our commitment to
          bringing vibrant, live jazz music to the community.

            Stones and Stevie Wonder. Our summer 2024 show, BIG BAND: Small
            Screen featured jazz renditions of music from cartoons and

          <p className="font-robotoThin mb-10 ">
            Jazz is America’s very own music. Participating in keeping it alive
            and growing is a wonderful way to remind all of us just how
            important it is to keep instrumental music in our schools. Learning
            music is not easy, but is a lifelong practice and a gift that should
            be accessible to everyone. This music provides an accessible point
            of entry for listeners of all ages and backgrounds.
